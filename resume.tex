\runsubsection{QA Git Web Tool}
\descript{| Datto Inc. Intern}
\location{Aug 2016 – Sept 2016 | Norwalk, CT \& Rochester, NY}
Deployed on a DLAMP device, a PHP webpage would allow a user to specify a repo and PR number to update or reset to master. The web handler would then validate the selection and resolve the proper path of the project and pass parameters to a shell script. The shell script would then make the proper git command to pull the repo and version onto the device for further use.

\runsubsection{Email Notifier}
\descript{| Datto Inc. Intern}
\location{June 2016 | Norwalk, CT}
Using a Raspberry Pi, a third party led beacon and a python script, the filtered folder
of an inbox was monitored for new, unread emails. On detection of a new message a
signal was sent to a designated pin on the Raspberry Pi and fed through an active low
relay which turned on the led. A second filtered folder was monitored for disabling
the led. The sender and time of this ”All Clear” email was logged.

Reverse engineering of the SNKRS iOS app distributed by Nike with a mitmproxy
allowed for use of mobile app exclusive API endpoints for desktop users. Detailed
product information was also able to be gathered from various endpoints. Crucial in
that purchases on the app were given precendece over desktop purchases.
